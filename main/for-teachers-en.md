It’s great that you want to bring Hedy into your classroom! On this page you’ll find all the tips & tricks to make your Hedy lessons run as smoothly as possible. 

## Introduction Hedy

### What’s Hedy?

Hedy is a textual programming language, specifically developed for (pre-)teens (10 to 15 years old).  In contrast to programming languages for kids, like Scratch, Hedy doesn’t use code blocks but textual code.  So with Hedy you’ll learn how to type code like the real programmers do, but in small steps with playful exercises. 

This way Hedy can function as a stepping stone to real programming languages like Python in an accessible and mostly fun way! 

Here you can watch a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) about the development of Hedy as a programming language. 

### Target audience

Hedy’s developed with middle school and junior high school students in mind (ages 10 - 15). It’s important for the students to be able to read well. We recommend not to start with Hedy before the students have achieved at least a 3rd grade reading level. Students (and teachers!) don’t need any programming experience before starting with Hedy. 

### Teaching with Hedy
Hedy is divided into levels, in which new commands are taught.Each level contains a variety of exercises to practice to newly learned commands. The exercises can be done by the students individually, or you can use them in classical instructions. The lesson plans for each level are included in this teacher manual.  The lesson plans and exercises are explained step by step, to make sure the less digitally informed teachers should be able to use Hedy too! 

Of course Hedy also caters to the creative teachers that love to make their own lessonplans and exercises! 

### Devices

Hedy is webbased, which means it works on any device with a browser (Google Chrome, FireFox, Edge etc), so laptops, chromebooks, tablets and even smartphones are suitable to use Hedy. There’s no need to download anything before working with Hedy, just go to the website and you’re all set!

Let the programming fun begin! 

## Teaching with Hedy 
When teaching with Hedy it's recommended to teach one level each lesson. This allows your students enough time to fully grasp the concepts the are taught in each level. 
This is the lessonplan we use and 

### Lessonplan
Introduction
In the introduction you can activate the students' prior knowledge of the subject. You can recall the commands they've learned in the previous levels, and remind them of mistakes that were frequently made in the previous levels. 

Introduction of the new concepts and commands
New commands and concepts can be quite difficult for the students. That's why it is very important to model the right use of a new command, especially in the lowest levels. New concepts for example variables can be hard to grasp at first for students, but we found that giving lots of examples can really help them. 

Practicing the new commands
Before starting the assignments/adventures, it's advised to let the students practice with the new commands. This way they can get familiar with the new commands, without having to implement it immediately in long codes. The 'try' buttons can come in handy. After some practice, the students can start working on the adventures.  

Working on the adventures
You can find several adventures in Hedy per level. The adventures are in order from easiest to hardest, so it's best to let the students start with the story adventure and work their way to the right side of the screen. Of course, it can also be fun to switch it up each level, or to think of your own assignments. The adventures often include examples of the code that students can copy into their code screen. Encourage your students to add their own ideas to the example codes to make it more interesting. 

Quiz
You can finish the lesson by letting your students test their knowledge in the quiz. 

Evaluation
Students often like showing their work to their teacher and classmates, so it's nice if you save some time at the end of your lesson to show a couple of programs made by the students. To round up the lesson you can also briefly summarize the learning goals of today's lesson. 

## Frequently made mistakes
Students learn most by making mistakes, but sometimes the mistakes are hard to find especially as the codes become longer and longer. Here is a list of frequently made mistakes per level, and how to fix them:  


### Frequently made mistakes Level 1

These are the frequently made mistakes by students in level 1: 

- Students forget to type the commands and write a code without starting with `print` for example.
- Students can misspell commands.   
- Students start the commands with a capital letter, even though all letters should be lowercase.
- Students forget to use the echo command and wonder why nothing happens after they filled in the question.  
- Sometimes students will get error messages from their browser that Hedy doesn’t work as it’s supposed to. The solution is to refresh the webpage. 

### Frequently made mistakes in level 2

These are the frequently made mistakes in level 2:

- Students make typos in the commands. 
- Students use the ask command the same way as they did in level 1. In levekl 2 they should use a variable.  
- Students sometimes tend to forget to type the commands. They start their code without typing `print` first. 
- Students use the command echo, which only works in level 1. In level 2 you can repeat a given answer by using the variable. 
- Students forget to use commas when making a list. For instance, they would make this code: 
 `animals is dog cat` instead of  `animals is dog, cat`. Hedy only prints one letter of the word in this case. 
- Students tend to use commas after a `print` command, this is not possible.
E.g. they program: `print Hello, I’m Hedy` instead of `print Hello I’m Hedy`

- Students use the name of a variable as a word in a print command, this is allowed from level 3 on. 
E.g. They program: 

```
animals is dog, cat, cow
print the best animals are…
print animals at random
```
Instead they should change the word animals in the second line into something other than animals. For example: 

```
animals is dog, cat, cow
print the best animal is…
print animals at random
```
- Students use multiple words as the name of their variable For example: 
```
black cats is ask Do you like black cats?
```
Instead they should name their variables with only one word like `blackcats` or just `cats`.
```
blackcats is ask Do you like black cats?
```

### Frequently made mistakes in level 3

These are the frequently made mistakes by students in level 3

- The same mistakes as level 2. 
- Students forget putting the quotation marks on both sides of the text after a print or ask command. 
- Students use the wrong quotation marks. The correct quotation mark is  ' you find in next to the enter button on most keyboards. Different quotation marks like the double marks &quot; or the skewed quotation mark ` (found in the left corner with ~) will not work.
- Students use an apostrophe in their texts or questions. For example `print 'I'm Hedy'`. This is not allowed, so it should be changed to `print 'Im Hedy' ` 

### Frequently made mistakes in level 4

These are the frequently made mistakes by students in level 4: 

- Mistake: Students put else on the next line, but it should be in the same line as the if command. 
Code: 
```
if name is Hedy print 'nice'
else print 'boo!'
```
Solution: Else should be in the same line as if. 

```
if name is Hedy print 'nice' else print 'boo!'
```
- Mistake: Students use apostrophes after a print command. 
```
print 'I'm Hedy'
```
Solution: Don’t use apostrophes.
```
print 'Im Hedy'
```
- Mistake: Students forget to use the print command when using an if command.
```
if name is Hedy 'nice' else 'boo!'
```
Solution: Use print twice when using both if and else. 
``` 
if name is Hedy print 'nice' else print 'boo!'
```

- Mistake: Students use different names for the same variable.
```
horse is ask 'What is your horse called?'
if me is Bonfire print 'nice' else print 'boo!'
```

Solution: Always use the same name for your variable (also check whether the variable name is singular or plural (answer/answers)). 
```
horse is ask 'what is your horse called?'
if horse is Bonfire print 'nice' else print 'boo!'
```

- Mistake: Students forget to type both of the quotation marks after print, when using if and else. 
```
if name is Hedy print nice else print 'boo!
```
Solution: Always use two quotation marks (both in front of and behind the text) for each print command in your code. 
```
if name is Hedy print 'nice' else print 'boo!'
```

- Mistake: Students use quotation marks around a variable. 
```
if 'name' is 'Hedy' print 'nice' else print 'boo!'
```
Solution: Don’t use quotation marks around a variable. 
```
if name is Hedy print 'nice' else print 'boo!'
```

- Mistake: Students give names to variables that consist of multiple words. 
```
Chosen door is ask 'Which door do you choose?'
```
Solution: A variable name should always just be one word. 
```
chosendoor is ask 'Which door do you choose?'
```

- Mistake: Students want multiple answers to be correct, when using if. 
```
if name is Jesse, David, Souf print 'you are funny' else print 'you are not funny'
```
Solution: Unfortunately, this is not allowed. You can only pick one name for each if command. On the other hand, you can use multiple if commands in one code, like the example beneath: 
```
name is ask What is your name?
if name is Jesse print 'you are funny'
if name is David print 'you are funny'
if name is Souf print 'you are funny'
```
Another solution is to make a variable list with the names, and let Hedy check if the given answer is in the list. Like this:
```
friends is Jesse, David, Souf
who is ask 'Who are you?'
if who in friends print 'you are funny' else print 'you are not funny'
```
- Mistake: Students give the same answer in ask as the variable name. For example this student made the password ‘password’.  
```
password is ask 'What is the secret password?'
If password is password print 'You can enter!' else print 'Access denied!' 
```
Solution: Choose a different name for the variable.
```
secretpassword is ask 'What is the secret password?'
if secretpassword is password print 'You can enter!' else print 'Access denied!' 
```

### Frequently made mistakes in level 5

These are the frequently made mistakes by students in level 5: 

- The same mistakes as in previous levels.
- Students tend to forget words in this command `repeat 3 times print`. Especially the words `print` or `times` are easily forgotten.

### Fequently made mistakes in level 6 

These are the frequently made mistakes by students in level 6: 
- The same mistakes as in previous levels. 
- The students do multiple caculations in one line, Hedy can't handle that so you should devide it into multiple lines. For example:
```
total is price + extras - discounts
print total
```
They should change it to: 
```
total is price + extras
total is total - discounts
print total
```
- Some calculations tend to get very long, for example in the restaurant adventure, some students make massive price lists with lots of meals on it. The easiest way to find a mistake in such a long code is cut (ctrl + X) the bottom part of the code and first try to run the first part. If that works, you can paste a couple of lines back and try again. Until you find the code that Hedy can't compute.

 ### Fequently made mistakes in level 6 

These are the frequently made mistakes by students in level 7: 
- The same mistakes as in previous levels. 
- The most frequent mistakes in level 7 have to do with indentation, so it's important to check if the students have used the same amount of spaces each time to indent.
